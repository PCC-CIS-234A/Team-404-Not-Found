# Story 2 â€“ Send Notification (Sprint 2 Final)
## Developer:
Sayan Tajul

## Overview:
This is the submission update for Sprint 2 Part 1 of the `sayan_send_notification` feature branch. The Send Notification functionality is now fully enhanced with dynamic tag support, user-friendly tag prompts, email formatting improvements, and UI polish. This version supports dynamic message customization using template tags that are auto-detected and filled in by the user via a popup interface.

---

## ðŸ”§ New Features & Enhancements:

### Dynamic Tag Recognition and Prompting
- Automatically detects all `{{tag_name}}` placeholders in the subject and message.
- Opens a centralized popup window prompting the user to fill in missing tag values.
- Uses **user-friendly descriptions** instead of raw tag names (e.g., `{{event_name}}` â†’ _"What is the name of the event?"_).

### Improved GUI Behavior
- Tag input popup window is **centered on the screen** and fixed at a readable size (500x400).
- Duplicate popups were eliminated with a clean and consistent design.
- Readable layout for subject/message, file attachments, and action buttons.

### Template Integration with Error Handling
- Dynamic loading of templates populates both subject and message fields.
- Error handling for database/template issues is displayed via message boxes.

### Enhanced Email Sending Logic
- Emails sent via Gmail SMTP with support for:
  - Dynamic content based on user input
  - File attachments
  - Clean formatting and tag replacement

### Robust Input Validation & Confirmation
- Validates subject and message length before sending.
- Confirms final message with user before proceeding.

### Debug Logs for Developers
- Helpful print/debug messages for:
  - Subscriber data
  - Sender verification
  - Database logging and attachments
